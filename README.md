# .files

These are my dotfiles.

They target macOS systems.

## Install
```bash
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasperV/dotfiles/master/upstall.sh | sh
```

## TODO
- [ ] git config; https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles#add-custom-commands-without-creating-a-new-fork - also use private email address
- [ ] Use lastpass helper vs osx helper; https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli/blob/master/contrib/examples/git-credential-lastpass
- [ ] Make sourcing in current shell scope as well
- [ ] Make short url -> rename install to upstall, put in folder, proper curl command like so: `curl get.darryl.sh | sh` all curl options - -O etc...
- [ ] verify commands and/or app invokations before they are used, to prevent errors
