# .files

These are my dotfiles.

They target macOS systems.

Still a bit messy, but I will cleanup up as I go along.

## Install
```bash
curl -Ls get.jasperv.nl | sh
```

## TODO
- [ ] verify commands and/or app invokations before they are used, to prevent errors, behave proper on multiple reruns - e.g. don't error, show info and update - upstall! use paulirish code!
