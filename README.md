# .files

These are my dotfiles.

They target macOS systems.

## TODO
- [ ] Use lastpass helper vs osx helper; https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli/blob/master/contrib/examples/git-credential-lastpass
- [ ] Make sourcing in current shell scope as well
- [ ] Make short url -> rename install to upstall, put in folder
